[00:00.11] I thought I saw your face today
[00:03.64] But I just turned my head away
[00:06.72] Your face against the trees
[00:10.27] But I just see the memories
[00:12.71] As they come, as they come
[00:25.71] 
[00:19.05] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:25.28] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:46.28] 
[00:31.83] I saw it glitter as I grew
[00:35.09] And loved it, boy, I never knew
[00:38.15] I thought this place was heaven sent
[00:41.46] But now it's just a monument in my mind, in my mind
[01:06.96] 
[00:50.11] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:56.38] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[01:17.38] 
[01:03.17] The cars and freeways implore me to stay away, out of this place
[01:08.99] My mother said, "Just keep your head
[01:12.11] And play it as it lays"
[01:23.61] 
[01:48.30] The cars and freeways implore me to stay away, out of this place
[01:54.02] My mother said, "Just keep your head
[01:57.19] And play it as it lays"
[02:08.69] 
[02:03.06] I somehow see what's beautiful in things that are ephemeral
[02:09.32] I'm my only friend of mine
[02:12.34] And love is just a piece of time in the world, in the world
[02:41.84] 
[02:20.66] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:26.50] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:47.50] 
[02:32.41] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:38.34] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
