I thought I saw your face today
But I just turned my head away
Your face against the trees
But I just see the memories
As they come As they come
And I couldn't help
but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help
but fall in love again
I saw it glitter as I grew
And loved a boy I never knew
I thought this place
was heaven-sent
But now it's just a monument
In my mind In my mind
And I couldn't help
but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help
but fall in love again
In the cars and freeways
and poor me Tuesday
Away out of this place
My mother said
just keep your head and play
As it plays
<♪>
In the cars and freeways
and poor me Tuesday
Away out of this place
My mother said
just keep your head and play
As it plays
I somehow see what's beautiful
In things that are ephemeral
I'm my only friend of mine
and love is
just a piece of time
In the world In the world
And I couldn't help
but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help
but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help
but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help
but fall in love again
