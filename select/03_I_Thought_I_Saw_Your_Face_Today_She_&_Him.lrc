[00:00.37] I thought I saw your face today
[00:03.38] But I just turned my head away
[00:06.58] Your face against the trees
[00:09.65] But I just see the memories
[00:12.78] As they come
[00:15.73] As they come
[00:18.85] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:25.09] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:31.81] I saw it glitter as I grew
[00:34.97] And loved a boy I never knew
[00:38.13] I thought this place was heaven-sent
[00:41.61] But now it's just a monument
[00:43.97] In my mind
[00:47.05] In my mind
[00:50.10] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[00:56.30] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[01:03.25] The cars and freeways implore me to stay
[01:06.41] Away out of this place
[01:08.93] My mother said, "Just keep your head
[01:11.90] And play it as it lays"
[01:48.37] The cars and freeways implore me to stay
[01:51.37] Away out of this place
[01:54.10] My mother said, "Just keep your head
[01:57.13] And play it as it lays"
[02:03.29] I somehow see what's beautiful
[02:06.30] In things that are ephemeral
[02:09.41] I'm my only friend of mine
[02:12.41] And love is just a piece of time
[02:14.73] In the world
[02:17.65] In the world
[02:20.69] And I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:26.60] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:32.43] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
[02:50.37] No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
